                        Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Nodejs allows JavaScript code to run outside the browser.

                        <p className='font-bold text-lg'> What is JavaScript?</p>
                        JavaScript is a scripting or high-level  programming language that based on prototype inheritance. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.

                        Node.js is well suited for applications that have a lot of concurrent connections and each request only needs very few CPU cycles, because the event loop (with all the other clients) is blocked during execution of a function.

                            <li> * It runs Javascript, so you can use the same language on server and client</li>
                            <li>* The single-threaded event-driven system is fast even when handling lots of requests at once, and also simple, compared to traditional multi-threaded Java or ROR frameworks.</li>
                            <li>* It seems quite suitable for prototyping, agile development and rapid product iteration.</li>
                            <li>* It has become the defector standard environment in which to run Javascript-related tools and other web-related tools, including task runners, minifiers, beautifiers, linters, processors, bundles and analytics processors.</li>

                        Mainly there are two types of database management systems (DBMS): Relational and NoSQL DBMS.
                        <p className='font-bold mt-3'> Relational DBMS  :-</p>
                        Relational DBMS manages the databases that store data in a structured format, using rows and columns
                        <p className='font-bold'> NoSQL DBMS  :-</p>
                        NoSQL DBMS manages the database that stores unstructured data in forms of collections and documents
                        <p className='font-bold mt-3'> MongoDB is a NoSQL DBMS, usually I prefer mongoDB for following reasons:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>* NoSQL Database Management Systems are more flexible than RDBMS</li>
                            <li>* The expense of maintaining and even setting up a RDBMS is relatively high</li>
                            <li>* MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data</li>
                            <li>* It holds a set of collections and stores data as document</li>
                            <li>* Can handle variety of data and huge amount of data</li>
                            <li>* It offers a MongoDB Node.js Driver which provides a JavaScript API and implements the network protocol required to read and write from a local or remote MongoDB database
                            </li>
